# Gulp Boilerplate

Current boilerplate for web development using ES6, Babel and Webpack.

All dev work goes into app folder.

* <em>gulp watch</em> - launches BrowserSync, compiles and refreshes on changes to JS/CSS/HTML
* <em>gulp build</em> - optimises, minifies, revisions and publishes to docs folder
